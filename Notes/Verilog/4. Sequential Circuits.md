A simple way to specify a storage element is by using the `if-else` statement to describe circuit behaviour to input changes:

```Verilog
	always @(Control, B) begin  
		if (Control) begin  
			A = B;  
		end  
	end
```
- A must be a reg

If `Control` is not true, the compiler assumes the value of `A` must be maintained
- The implied memory is realized by instantiating a latch in the circuit
	- Since no `else` is given, a latch will by synthesized to hold the value of A

# Edge-Triggering in Always Blocks
```Verilog
	module D_flipflop(
		input wire q,
		input wire clk,
		output reg q
	);
		always @(posedge clk) begin
			q = d;
		end
	endmodule
```

# Blocking vs. Non-Blocking Assignments
In all our Verilog examples presented so far, we have used the equal sign for assignment
- This is called a **blocking** assignment
- A Verilog compiler evaluates the statement in a sequential block (always or initial) in the order they are written

We can use the less-than-equal sign for assignment
- This is called a **non-blocking** assignment
- All non-blocking assignment statements in an “always” block are evaluated using the values that the variables have when the “always” block is entered  
- Thus a given variable has the same value for all statements in the block  
- The meaning of non-blocking is that the results of each assignment is not seen until the end of the “always” block

```Verilog
	always @(posedge Clock) begin
		Q1 <= D;
		Q2 <= Q1;
	end
```
- Value of Q2 won't be D (like in blocking), it will instead be the value of Q1 at the start of the always block (before D)

The use of **blocking assignments** for **sequential circuits** can easily lead to wrong results
- Only **non-blocking assignments** should be used to describe **sequential circuits**

# Flip-Flops with Clear Capability
By using a particular sensitivity list (always block params) and a specific style of `if-else`, it is possible to include clear (or preset) signals on a flip-flop

## D Flip-Flop with Async Clear
```Verilog
	module flipflop (
		input wire D,
		input wire Clock,
		input wire Resetn,
		output reg Q
	);
		always @(negedge Resetn, posedge Clock) begin
			if (!Resetn)
				Q <= 0
			else
				Q <= D
		end
	endmodule
```

## D Flip-Flop with Sync Clear
```Verilog
	module flipflop (
		input wire D,
		input wire Clock,
		input wire Resetn,
		output reg Q
	);
		always @(posedge Clock) begin
			if (!Resetn)
				Q <= 0
			else
				Q <= D
		end
	endmodule
```
