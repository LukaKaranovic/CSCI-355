## Synthesis Using Base Gates
We want to be able to implement arbitrary functions using the AND, OR, and NOT  
gates  
- Assume we want to implement:

| x1  | x2  | f(x1, x2) |
| --- | --- | --------- |
| 0   | 0   | 1         |
| 0   | 1   | 1         |
| 1   | 0   | 0         |
| 1   | 1   | 1         |
- Can come up with a logic expression which is “1” for each output “1” in the truth table:
- f(x1, x2) = ~x1 * ~x2 + ~x1 * x2 + x1 * x2
- We can simplify the logic expression using Boolean algebra:
	- Using 12a: ~x1 * ~x2 + x2 * (x1 + ~x1)
	- Using 8b: ~x1 * ~x2 + x2 * 1
	- Using 6a: ~x1 * ~x2 + x2
	- Using 16a: ~x1 + x2

There are many ways in which a logic expression can be minimized using Boolean algebra.
- This process can be daunting, but we will be looking at a simpler, graphical technique called "Karnaugh Maps" (K-Maps).

# Minterms
For a function of **n** variables, a product term in which each of the **n** varibles appears once in a called a "minterm".
- The variables may appear in either their uncomplemented or complemented form
- For a given row of a truth table, the minterm is formed by:
	- including x1 if x1 = 1
	- including ~x1 is x1 = 0
![[minterms.png]]
# Sum of Products
A function f can be represented by an expression that is a sum of minterms  
- Only the minterms that correspond to the rows for which **f = 1** appear in the resulting expression  
- Any function f can be represented by a sum of minterms:  
	- Resulting implementation is functionally correct  
	- Not necessarily the lowest-cost implementation  
- A logic expression consisting of product (AND) terms that are summed (OR-ed) is said to be in the **“sum-of-products” (SOP) form**  
- If **each product term is a minterm**, then the expression is called a **“canonical sum-of-products” form**
### Example
![[sopexample.png]]
- Canonical SOP expression is ~x1~x2x3 + x1~x2~x3 + x1~x2x3 + x1x2~x3

# Maxterms
- For a function of n variables, a sum term in which each **complement** of the n variables appears **once** is called a **maxterm** 
- The variables may appear in either their uncomplemented or complemented form  
- For a given row of a truth table, the maxterm is formed by:  
	- Including xi if xi = 0  
	- Including ~xi if xi = 1
![[maxterms.png]]

# Product of Sums
A function f can be represented by an expression that is a product of maxterms  
- Only the maxterms that correspond to the rows for which **f = 0** appear in the resulting expression  
- Any function f can be represented by a product of maxterms:  
	- Resulting implementation is functionally correct  
	- Not necessarily the lowest-cost implementation  
- A logic expression consisting of sum (OR) terms that are multiplied (AND-ed) is said to be in the **“products-of-sum” (POS) form**  
- If each product term is a maxterm, then the expression is called a **“canonical products-of-sum” form**
![[posex.png]]
- Canonical POS expression is (x1x2x3)(x1~x2x3)(x1~x2~x3)(~x1~x2~x3)

# NAND and NOR
Besides using AND, OR, and NOT gates, NAND and NOR are particularly useful functions  
- NAND is obtained by complementing the output of an AND gate  
- NOR is obtained by complementing the output of an OR gate  
- These functions are attractive as they can be **implemented with simpler electronic circuits** than AND and OR gates  
- A “bubble” is placed on the output side of the AND and OR gate symbols to represent the complemented output signal

# Design Examples
Logic circuits provide a solution to a problem  
- Regardless of the complexity of a given circuits, a designer of logic circuits are confronted with the same basic issues:  
	- It is necessary to specify the desired **behaviour** of the circuit  
	- The circuit has to be **synthesized** and **implemented**  
- The implemented circuit has to be **tested** to verify that it meets the **specifications**

## Example
SOP:
(~x1~x2~x3x4) + (x1~x2~x3~x4) + (x1~x2~x3x4) + (x1x2~x3~x4)

(~x1~x2~x3x4) + (x1~x2~x3x4) + (x1~x2~x3~x4) + (x1x2~x3~x4)

(~x1 + x1)(~x2~x3x4) + (x1~x3~x4)(~x2 + x2)

(~x2~x3x4) + (x1~x3~x4)
~x3((~x2x4) + (x1~x4))

(~xy) + (z~y)

# Three-Way Light Control Design
- Assume that a large room has three doors and that a switch near each door controls a light in the room  
- It has to be possible to turn the lights on or off by changing the state of any one of the switches  
1. Turn this word statement into a formal specification:  
	- Assume that the light is off if all the switches are open  
	- Closing any one of the switches will turn the light on  
	- Turning on a second switch will have to turn the light off  
	- Turning on all three switches will have to turn the light on
2. Truth Table

| sw1 | sw2 | sw3 | light (1 for on) |
| --- | --- | --- | ---------------- |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0                |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 1                |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1                |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 0                |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 1                |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 0                |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0                |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1                |

3. Canonical SOP
- f = (~x1~x2x3) + (~x1x2~x3) + (x1~x2~x3) + (x1x2x3)
- Realization:
- ![[threewaylightsop.png]]
4. Canonical POS
- f = (x1 + x2 + x3)(x1 + ~x2 + ~x3)(~x1 + x2 + ~x3)(~x1 + ~x2 + x3)
- Realization:
- ![[threewaylightpos.png]]
# Multiplexer Circuit
It is often necessary to choose data from several sources  
- We want to design a circuit that produces an output that has the same value of one of two inputs, x1 or x2, depending on the value of selection control signal s:  
	- The output of the circuit will be the same as x1 if s = 0  
	- The output of the circuit will be the same as x2 if s = 1

| s   | x1  | x2  | f(s, x1, x2) |
| --- | --- | --- | ------------ |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | 0            |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | 0            |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | 1            |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | 1            |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | 0            |
| 1   | 0   | 1   | 1            |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | 0            |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | 1            |
or

| s   | f(s, x1, x2) |
| --- | ------------ |
| 0   | x1           |
| 1   | x2           |
- From truth table, we derive the canonical SOP
	- f = ~sx1~x2 + ~sx1x2 + s~x1x2 + sx1x2
	- (~sx1)(x2 + ~x2) + (sx2)(x1 + ~x1)
	- Simplified to f = ~sx1 + sx2
	- Realization
	- ![[multiplexerimplementation.png]]
This type of circuit is called a **multiplexer**:
- It "multiplexes" input signals onto a single output
- This is a 2-to-1 multiplexer
- ![[School/CSCI 355/Pasted Image Bin/2to1multiplexer.png]]
- The same idea can be extended to larger circuits (e.g. 4-to-1 multiplexer)

## Example
![[numberdisplayexample.png]]
Extract terms (column by column) for each output to construct a multiplexer:
- a = ~s0
- b = 1
- c = ~s1
- d = ~s0
- e = ~s0
- f = ~s1~s0
- g = s1

In this display, input '11' is treated as "we don't care", meaning we just ignore the input.
