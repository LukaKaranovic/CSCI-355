- suitable for high volume IC production
- Ex. Pentium (x86)
**Semi-Custom**

## Design Technology
**Capture**
- schematic
- hardware description language (HDL)
	- An **HDL** is a text-based computer language used to describe the structure and behaviour of electronic circuits (such as ASICs and FPGAs).
	- Ex. VHDL and Verilog
**Minimization and Synthesis**
- combinatorial circuits
	- Type of digital logic circuit where the output is solely determined by the **current** combination of its input signals.
	- Ex. datapath components
- sequential circuits
	- Type of digital logic circuit whose output depends on **both the current** inputs and its **internal memory,** which stores part inputs and outputs.
	- Ex. control unit as a finite state machine (FSM)
**Testing**
- behaviour
- timing
- manufacture

# Implementation Options

## Breadboarding
A **breadboard** is a construction base used to build semi-permanent prototypes of electronic circuits.
![[breadboarding.png]]

## Microcontroller
A **microcontroller** is a tiny. self-contained computer on a single microchip that contains a CPU, memory, and programmable I/O.
- Designed for specific, dedicated tasks within embedded systems like household appliances, vehicles, and robots.

- no fundamental difference between what hardware and software can implement  
- any processor technology can be mapped to any IC technology  
- any choice between hardware and software for a particular function is a tradeoff among design metrics such as  
	- performance  
	- power  
	- size
	- non-recurring engineering costs (NRE)  
	- time to market  

## Codesign
An **ASIC** (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit) is a microchip custom-designed to **perform a particular function or set of tasks,** rather than for general-purpose use.

## System on a Chip (SoC)
An **SoC** is a single integrated circuit that combines most or all of a computer's or electronic system's components (CPU, memory, GPU, I/O controllers) onto one microchip.
- Creates a compact, power-efficient, and cost-effective solution for electronic devices (smartphones and tablets, etc. use this)

# Circuit Design Flow for 355

- Not doing breadboards anymore

# Digital Hardware
- Logic circuits are used to build computer hardware and many other types of products
- These are classified as 'digital' hardware
- Digital derives from the way information is presented: as electronic signals that correspond to digits of information.
	- Analog - continuous signals
	- Digital - discrete values
		- In a 5v system:
			- logic 1 = anything over 3v
			- logic 0 = anything near 0v
- Until the 1960s, logic circuits were constructed using discrete components like individual transistors or resistors
- The advent of 'integrated circuits' made it possible to place a number of transistors (the entire circuit) on a single chip.

## Digital Circuit
- By 1970, it was possible to implement all of the circuitry of a microprocessor on a single chip.
- Although these microprocessors had limited computing power by today's standards, they opened the door for the information processing revolution and affordable PCs

## Types of Chips
In 1996, a chip had 10mil transistors, in 2022 that was up to 114 000 million transistors

**Standard Chips**
- Numerous chips that provide commonly-used circuits
- Each contains a small number of elements (typically less than 100 transistors) and performs a single function
**Programmable Logic Devices**
- Circuitry can be configured by the user to implement a wide range of logic circuits
- Most commonly used type are known as Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
**Custom-Designed Chips**
- Often called Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)
- Design can be optimized for a specific task.

## Design Process
- The availability of computer-based tools has greatly influenced the design process
- The following flowchart depicts a typical development process
![[designflowchart1.png]]
![[designflowchart2.png]]
- Process begins with the definition of product specifications
- The initial design is difficult to automate and usually requires considerable design experience and intuition
- Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tools are used to work out the details of the design
- A complete physical prototype is constructed and tested
- May require going back to design phase if significant errors uncovered

## Structure of a Computer
