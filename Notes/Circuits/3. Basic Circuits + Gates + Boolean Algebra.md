## Variables and Functions
- Domination of binary circuits in digital systems is due to their simplicity, reliability, and fault tolerance  
- The simplest binary element is a switch that has two states, open and closed (can be implemented by a transistor)
![[switchstates.png]]

## Simple Switch Application
- The current flows when the switch is closed (i.e. when x = 1)
- The output is defined as the state of the light, which we will denote by the letter “L”
	- If the light is **on**, we will say that L = 1  
	- If the light is **off**, we will say that L = 0 
- We can describe the state of the light as a function of the “input variable” x:  
	- L(x) = x  
![[switchlightapp.png]]

### Two Switches in Series
- The light will be turned on only if both switches are closed.
- If either switch is open, the light will be off:
	- L(x1, x2) = x1 * x2 (* means and)
		- where L = 1 if x1 = 1 and x2 = 1
		- else L = 0
- The **dot** (I'm using \*) symbol is called the '**AND**' operator
- The circuit below is said to implement a 'logical AND' function:
![[switchseries.png]]
### Two Switches in Parallel
- The light will be turned on if either (or both) switches are closed:
	- L(x1, x2) = x1 + x2 (+ means or)
- The '**+**' symbol is called the '**OR**' operator.
- The circuit below is said to implement a 'logical OR' function.

## Basic Logic Functions
- The **AND** and OR **functions** are two of the most important logic functions  
- Together with the “inversion” function, they can be used as building blocks for the implementation of all logic circuits

# Inversion
- Often it is useful and more efficient to take a **positive action** when a switch is **opened** (opposite of the previous cases)
- A **closed** switch will short-circuit the light and **turn it off.**
- The light will be **turned on** when the switch is **opened**.
![[inversionexample.png]]
- This can be expressed as L(x) = ~x (or bar above x)
	- L = 1 if x = 0
	- L = 0 if x = 1
- The value of this function is the 'inverse' of the input variable.
	- Also referred to as the '**complement**' or the '**NOT**' operator.

# Truth Tables
**Truth tables** are used to define the operation of a circuit in the form of a table.
- All of the combinations of the **inputs** are listed in the **left** columns and the **outputs** are listed in the **right** columns
![[truthtableex.png]]
- The required number of rows in a truth table is 2<sup>n</sup>, where n is the number of input variables.

# Logic Gates and Networks
The three basic logic operations (AND, OR, NOT) can be used to implement logic functions of **any complexity**.

Each logic operation can be implemented electronically with transistors, resulting in a circuit element called a **logic gate.**  
- A **logic gate** has one or more inputs and **one output** that is a function of its inputs.

## AND Gate
![[andgate.png]]
- Output is 1 only if all of the inputs are 1.
- Minimum of two inputs, but can be more than two inputs
## OR Gate
![[orgate.png]]
- Output is 1 if either (or both) inputs are 1
- Minimum of two inputs, but can be more than two inputs.

## NOT Gate / Inverter
![[notgate.png]]
- Always one input
- Output is the inverse (complement) of the input

## Logic Circuit
A **larger** circuit is implanted by a network of gates. This is called a **logic network** or **logic circuit**.

### Analysis of a Logic Network
- A designer of digital systems is faced with **two basic issues:**  
	- **Analysis** of an existing logic network  
	- **Synthesis** of designing a logic network  
- The analysis process is typically simpler than the synthesis process  
- To **analyze** a logic network, we can simply **apply all possible combinations of inputs and determine its outputs**  
	- We can then express those results in a truth table
- **Synthesizing** a logic network is basically like compiling it.

# Timing Diagrams
A **timing diagram** is a graphical representation of the input and output **waveforms**.  
- The time runs from left to right with each input held for some **fixed duration**  
- In idealized timing diagrams, the outputs of gates change immediately as its inputs change  
- In reality, there is a **delay** between the outputs of a gate changing  
- Timing diagrams also can be useful for showing these delays
![[timingdiagram.png]]

## Functionally Equivalent Networks
Consider the network g = ~x1 + x2
- It has the same output as the previous circuit (~x1 + x1 * x2) for all combinations of input
- The two networks are deemed **functionally equivalent.**
- We would usually use the simpler (cheaper) network.
- That means: ~x1 + x1 * x2 = ~x1 + x2

## XOR Example
![[lightswitchdiagram.png]]
- This behaviour is similar to two 3-way light switches controlling the lights of a staircase in a house (with one switch at the top of the stairs and the other at the bottom)
- This logic can be implemented by the following diagram:
- ![[xorlogicnetwork.png]]
- The logic function is very useful and called the 'excusive-OR' or '**XOR**'
- The output is true when **one** (but not both) inputs are true.
- ![[xorgate.png]]
## NAND and NOR Gates
NAND is 'not and', it is ~(A * B).
NOR is 'not or', it is ~(A + B)

## Gates for Addition
Consider adding two digits:
![[twodigitadd.png]]
- Looking at the truth table:
	- s0 can be generated by an AND gate
	- s1 can be generated by an XOR gate
- ![[adder.png]]

# Boolean Algebra
- In 1849, George Boole published a scheme for the algebraic description of processes involved in logical thought and reasoning  
	- This became known as **Boolean algebra**
	- In 1930s, Claude Shannon showed that Boolean algebra provides an effective means of describing circuits built with switches  
- We will show that Boolean algebra is a powerful tool that can be used for designing and analyzing logic circuits

## Order of Operations
**Parentheses** can be used to specify the order of performing Boolean Algebra  
- To reduce the need to always use parentheses, the default ordering is **NOT then AND then OR**
- It is customary to omit the dot (or '\*') operator when there is no ambiguity.

**We are given a Boolean algebra axioms sheet for future reference.**

## Notation / Terminology
Boolean algebra is based on AND and OR operations.
- For which we have adopted the symbols “·” and “+”  
- Very similar to normal arithmetic operations except for “+”:  
	- Boolean: 1 + 1 = 1  
	- Arithmetic: 1 + 1 = (10)<sub>2</sub>  
- OR is often called the “logical sum” operator, AND is often called the “product” operator, usually just say “sum” and “product”.

## Duality
The axioms and single-variable theorems are listed in pairs  
- This is done to reflect the **principle of duality**
- Given a logic expression, its **dual** is created by:  
	- Replacing all “+” operators with “.” operators, and vice versa  
	- Replacing all 0s with 1s, and vice versa  
- The dual of any axiom or theorem is also a true statement  
- Duality becomes important later on when it is shown that **every** logic function can be expressed in **at least two** different ways  
- Often one expression leads to a **simpler physical implementation** and is thus preferred

### Two and Three-Variable Properties
We can prove these properties either by perfect induction or by performing  
algebraic manipulation:
- ~(x * y) = ~x + ~y (DeMorgan's Theorem)
	- Using perfect induction and putting into a truth table:
	- ![[demorganprooftable.png]]
### Example
![[logicequivalenceproofex.png]]

## DeMorgan's Theorems
DeMorgan's Theorems are particularly useful for simplifying logic expressions with inversions:
- f = ~((~a * ~b) + ~c)
	- = ~(~a * ~b) * ~(~c)
	- = ~(~a) + ~(~b) * c
	- (a + b) * c
